# Slate's Shipyard

This is the official documentation for Slate's Shipyard, a framework for creating custom vehicles and managing custom vehicles addons in the game [Outer Wilds](https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/outer-wilds.html) by Mobius Digital. Creating said vehicles require some coding and unity knowledge.

## Modules
Slate's Shipyard was made to have modules to make implementing unique types of vehicle easier. Stuff like wheels or wings aren't easy to implement in a way that works with Outer Wilds system, so it is its goal to add this functionality in a easy to use way.

Currently the modules that exist are:

* Wheels Module:
    * [OWSimpleRaycastWheel]({{ 'OW Simple Raycast Wheel'|route }})
    * [BasicWheelController]({{ 'Basic Wheel Controller'|route }})

All these modules are under the `SlateShipyard.Modules` namespace.

## Tutorials
Tutorials for using each module will be made in the future, so in the mean time you can look at the code documentation and mods like [Car Example](https://github.com/ShoosGun/CarExample) and [Spaceshipinha](https://github.com/ShoosGun/Spaceshipinha) which were made with this framework to learn how to use it.
